This project requires an API key from [CricAPI](https://www.cricapi.com/) to fetch live cricket data.

### Steps to get started:
1. Visit [https://www.cricapi.com/](https://www.cricapi.com/) and sign up to get a free API key.
2. Open the `script.js` file.
3. Replace the placeholder with your API key:
   ```javascript
   const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";

##Acknowledgements

- I have taken help from **ChatGPT** for understanding how to use the CricAPI for fetching cricket data and also for the moving background color animation.
- For the **rotating players animation**, I referred to a **YouTube tutorial**.
